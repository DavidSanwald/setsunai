If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n\t * following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.5.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curry\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t  if (length === 1) {\n\t    return _curry1(fn);\n\t  }\n\t  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 489 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry1 = __webpack_require__(128);\n\tvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(129);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Optimized internal two-arity curry function.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} The curried function.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _curry2(fn) {\n\t  return function f2(a, b) {\n\t    switch (arguments.length) {\n\t      case 0:\n\t        return f2;\n\t      case 1:\n\t        return _isPlaceholder(a) ? f2\n\t             : _curry1(function(_b) { return fn(a, _b); });\n\t      default:\n\t        return _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(b) ? f2\n\t             : _isPlaceholder(a) ? _curry1(function(_a) { return fn(_a, b); })\n\t             : _isPlaceholder(b) ? _curry1(function(_b) { return fn(a, _b); })\n\t             : fn(a, b);\n\t    }\n\t  };\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 490 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _arity = __webpack_require__(219);\n\tvar _isPlaceholder = __webpack_require__(129);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Internal curryN function.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity of the curried function.\n\t * @param {Array} received An array of arguments received thus far.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} The curried function.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = function _curryN(length, received, fn) {\n\t  return function() {\n\t    var combined = [];\n\t    var argsIdx = 0;\n\t    var left = length;\n\t    var combinedIdx = 0;\n\t    while (combinedIdx < received.length || argsIdx < arguments.length) {\n\t      var result;\n\t      if (combinedIdx < received.length &&\n\t          (!_isPlaceholder(received[combinedIdx]) ||\n\t           argsIdx >= arguments.length)) {\n\t        result = received[combinedIdx];\n\t      } else {\n\t        result = arguments[argsIdx];\n\t        argsIdx += 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combined[combinedIdx] = result;\n\t      if (!_isPlaceholder(result)) {\n\t        left -= 1;\n\t      }\n\t      combinedIdx += 1;\n\t    }\n\t    return left <= 0 ? fn.apply(this, combined)\n\t                     : _arity(left, _curryN(length, combined, fn));\n\t  };\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 491 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = __webpack_require__(505);\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 492 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * Copyright 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n\t * All rights reserved.\n\t *\n\t * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n\t * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
